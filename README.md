 React App with NASA APIs ðŸš€

 This page uses React to show APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) published by NASA for that particular day.
 You can click on the â„¹ï¸Ž icon to see the details of the pic.

 Future Changes:
 Pictures are currently getting filled on the viewport according to the device size but sometimes the whole picture is much bigger in size and the viewport misses to show the actual beauty of the pic.
 There should be an option present on screen for user to view the whole image or to set the specific selection as the bg image of teh page.
