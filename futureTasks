Bugs/ Improvements:

1. Pictures are currently getting filled on the viewport according to the device size but 
sometimes the whole picture is much bigger in size and the viewport misses to 
show the actual beauty of the pic. There should be an option present on screen for user 
to view the whole image or to set the specific selection as the bg image of the page.
